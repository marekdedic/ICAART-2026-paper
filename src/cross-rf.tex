\section{\uppercase{The Cross-RF Method for Hyper-Parameter Optimization on Graph Datasets}}

In this section, we introduce the Cross-RF method, a novel approach for hyper-parameter optimization specifically designed for graph datasets.

Suppose we have a so-called \name{meta-model} \( \mathcal{M}_\rho \) that takes as input a graph dataset \( \mathcal{D} \) and a hyper-parameter configuration \( \lambda \), and outputs an estimate of a performance metric \( \rho \) (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) of a machine learning model trained on \( \mathcal{D} \) with the hyper-parameter configuration \( \lambda \). Using this, we can define the Cross-RF method as follows:
\[ \tau \left( \mathcal{D}, \mathscr{F}, \tilde{\Lambda}, \rho \right) = \argmax_{\lambda \in \tilde{\Lambda}} \mathcal{M}_\rho \left( \mathcal{D}, \lambda \right) \]
where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \( \mathcal{D} \) is the target graph dataset for which we want to optimize hyper-parameters.
	\item \( \mathscr{F} \) is an inducer function that maps hyper-parameter configurations to machine learning models.
	\item \( \tilde{\Lambda} \) is a predefined set of hyper-parameter configurations to be evaluated.
	\item \( \rho \) is the performance metric we aim to optimize (i.e.\ the outer loss).
\end{itemize}
The feasibility of the Cross-RF method relies on the construction of the meta-model \( \mathcal{M}_\rho \) and on its computational complexity -- namely, the meta-model must be fast enough so that evaluating it on every hyper-parameter configuration from \( \tilde{\Lambda} \) at every step of the optimization isn't prohibitively costly.

To build the meta-model \( \mathcal{M}_\rho \), we will use a standard simple regression model (in our case, a Random Forest Regressor, but other regression models could be used as well) trained on a meta-dataset \( \mathcal{H} \).
The meta-dataset \( \mathcal{H} \) is constructed by collecting dataset properties, hyper-parameter configurations, and corresponding performance metrics across the progress of the training:
\[ \mathcal{H} = \left\{ \left( D^{(1)}, \lambda^{(1)}, \rho( \mathvec{y}_{\mathcal{D}^{(1)}}, \hat{f} \left( \mathmat{X}_{\mathcal{D}^{(1)}} \right) ) \right), \left( D^{(2)}, \lambda^{(2)}, \rho( \mathvec{y}_{\mathcal{D}^{(2)}}, \hat{f} \left( \mathmat{X}_{\mathcal{D}^{(2)}} \right) ) \right), \dots \right\} \]
