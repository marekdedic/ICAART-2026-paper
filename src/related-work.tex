\begin{itemize}
	\item \cite{yuan_which_2021} focuses on a limited selection of hyper-parameters and only evaluates them on a single molecular dataset.
	\item \cite{yuan_genetic_2021} proposes a specific genetic algorithm for hyper-parameter optimization but does not compare it to other optimization methods. Also, it only uses 3 molecular datasets for evaluation.
	\item \cite{yuan_systematic_2021} is the most relevant work, but it only evaluates on 3 molecular datasets.
	\item \cite{vodilovska_hyperparameter_2023} focuses on hyper-parameter optimization for graph neural networks for mRNA degradation prediction. It includes a broader set op hyper-aparameters, but only evaluates the methods on a single dataset.
	\item \cite{ebadi_hyperparameter_2025} only reviews cheminformatics-specific datasets and is not broadly applicable to other domains.
