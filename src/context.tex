\section{\uppercase{Wider context and Notation}}

Introduce HPO and all the necessary notation here. Explain the difference between HPO and NAS\@. Mention the importance of HPO in ML pipelines. Discuss common methods used in HPO, such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, etc. Provide examples of hyperparameters that are commonly tuned in machine learning models.

Mostly follow the notation from \cite{bischl_hyperparameter_2023}.
